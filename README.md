# poisoned-eden.github.io  Professional Portfolio 

## Description

This is my professional portfolio.  It was written as coursework for my coding bootcamp, and as such used specific techniques, and not others. 

I build this to practice and showcase my CSS skills, as well as highlighting the different projects I've created to potential employers and other interested folks.

In building this, I learnt that I much prefer Bootstrap to vanilla CSS.  There is no Bootstrap in the project as it was focusing on my "advanced CSS" skills (media queries, flexbox, CSS variables, combinators etc)
