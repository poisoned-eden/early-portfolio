                <img src="assets/images/Lilith-profile-pic.jpg">
                <p>Hi, I'm Lilith.  I originally got into coding through working on a website at the Environmental Consultancy I worked at.  I swiftly discovered I enjoyed it, and was given other interesting little projects and tools to build for the company, in various different languages and contexts such as Python for GIS, VBA for Excel, and SQL.</p>
                <p>Since then, much has happened.  I spent quite a while as a full-time parent, during which I learned about, and got diagnosed with, ADHD.  The particular mix of ADHD and carrying the mental load of a family has led me to seek technological solutions to make daily life easier.  As I have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of actually usable and useful tools, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make the damn things myself.</p>
                <p>So watch this space.  Big things are coming!</p>
                <p>I'm currently studying an intensive Full Stack Web Development "Coding Bootcamp" through the University of Birmingham.  The pages deployed on my github are coursework assignments for this. I am also self-employed as a Virtual Assistant, and have created the websites linked below for clients.</p>
